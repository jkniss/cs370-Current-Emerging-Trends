Repository for SNHU CS-370

CS-370 focused on advanced topics of computer science, including artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. 
The files attached to this repository showcases my ability to apply key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to a real-world problem.

What code were you given?
You are working as an AI developer for a gaming company, and tasked with creating a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent. 

What code did you create yourself?
I created code inside the qtrain() function for the pirate agent to successfully navigate the maze, while maximizing the reward.

Connect your learning from through this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are professionals who research ideas, conduct experiments and apply their knowledge of computer science to solve problems. Without computer scientists, many of the technological advancements we enjoy today would not be possible. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When solving a problem, I first try to gather as much information as possible about the subject. I like take a pragmatic approach and break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I feel it is my responsibility:
  Protect any information that has been entrusted to me by creating secure code. 
  Use my knowledge and skills to create a product that does not cause harm. 
  Question data and challenge hidden biases that may be present.
  Create a product that has the ability to reach the widest possible audience by being inclusive.
